This
programming
assignment
is
an
exercise
is
creating
and
using
a
hash
table
that
employs
quadratic
probing
for
handling
collisions
For
this
assignment
I
ask
you
to
a
program
that
reads
strings
of
characters
from
a
file
and
places
the
distinct
strings
case
sensitive
in
a
hash
table
with
the
entry
for
a
given
string
keeping
track
of
the
number
of
probes
needed
to
put
the
entry
in
the
table
and
the
number
of
times
the
given
string
appears
in
the
file
Once
the
strings
have
been
stored
in
the
table
your
program
should
display
the
number
of
distinct
entries
in
the
table
the
average
number
of
probes
to
store
entries
in
the
table
and
then
words
from
a
second
file
and
state
the
frequency
stored
in
the
table
for
each
of
the
words
the
word
is
not
in
the
table
Notes
You
should
use
an
array
of
pointers
to
records
to
implement
the
table
A
record
should
store
a
string
the
number
of
probes
and
the
frequency
of
occurrence
of
the
given
string
NULL
pointers
indicate
free
space
Your
program
should
not
make
any
assumptions
about
the
size
of
the
hash
table
Instead
it
should
count
the
number
of
lines
in
the
input
file
allocate
a
table
of
prime
size
at
least
twice
as
large
as
the
number
of
lines
rewind
the
file
and
enter
the
distinct
strings
in
the
table
I
have
stored
test
input
files
in
proj
csc109
p7
p7
dat
the
words
to
be
entered
in
the
table
and
proj
csc109
p7
p7
freq
the
words
whose
frequencies
are
to
be
displayed
To
run
your
program
I
should
be
able
to
type
p7
p7
dat
p7
freq
You
should
have
the
usual
Makefile
and
as
usual
you
should
touch
DONE
when
you
are
ready
to
submit
your
program
Your
program
can
assume
that
the
input
files
have
no
blank
lines
and
have
exactly
one
string
on
each
line
I
created
p7
dat
by
extracting
all
the
strings
from
this
file
I
modified
Lex
so
that
it
allows
upper
case
characters
in
a
string
and
then
printed
the
word
that
corresponded
to
any
entry
whose
token
was
IDENTIFIER
I
am
happy
that
so
far
you
have
heeded
the
warning
below
Once
again
I
remind
you
to
avoid
unfair
collaboration
To
understand
what
is
meant
by
unfair
collaboration
the
syllabus
again
